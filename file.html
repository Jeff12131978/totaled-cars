        <p>Totaled Car Insurance
            If your car has been “totaled” after an accident, it means the cost of repairing it is greater than the cost to replace it. A car can also be considered a total loss when it’s not safe to repair, or if it simply can’t be returned to its pre-accident condition. 
            
            What’s a totaled car?
            After you’ve been in an accident, the insurance adjuster looks at your car’s damage. In some cases they could declare it totaled. Even if you managed to drive the car away from the scene, it could still be totaled if the cost of repairs exceeds its value. 
            
            In short: A totaled car is a car that’s been in a car accident, or otherwise damaged, after which the cost of repairs (plus its salvage value) exceeds its actual cash value.</p>

        <p1>The payout on your totaled car depends on your specific insurance policy, the amount you owe on your loan (if you have one), and your deductible. Most car insurance policies contain both collision coverage and comprehensive coverage. The type of loss you’re involved in determines which one kicks in.</p1>
